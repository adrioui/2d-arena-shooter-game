Note: this game is still under development.
## 2d Arena Shooter game made with LÃ–VE framework in lua for CS50 final project.

### Background
I'm taking inspiration from games that I like the most when I was a kid: arena shooter games. 
I'm hoping this game will make the player happy.

### How to download
Download this zip file [2d Arena Shooter Game](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cBo7Y07ilEMbzg_7tQlt4mxW592NeW_Z/view?usp=sharing), unzip all the files in a folder, and
run the .exe file. 

### How to play
Move your mouse cursor to move the ship; ship follows the mouse cursor. The farther the cursor to the ship the faster it moves.
Press spacebar to fire the bullet from the ship and aim using the mouse cursor.
Enemy will spawn at random places and follow the ship wherever the ship moves. Fire them to make them dissapear.

#### Current updates
25/11/2022: Check collision between the character and enemy to make the enemy dissapear, if collided.
And check collision between the bullet and enemy. 

26/11/2022: Make the bullet dissapear after 4 seconds it fired from the ship.

27/11/2022: Added a feature so that when the bullet hit the enemy, they both will dissapear. Previously this feature didn't work
because I incorporated other feature that would make a bullet dissapear 4 seconds after the player firing it.

#### Latest updates
27/11/2022: Add enemy that shoot bullets toward the player.

28/11/2022: Change the previous feature. Make the enemy firing bullets toward the same direction as the bullets fired from the player.
