Note: this game is still under development.
## 2d Arena Shooter game made with LÃ–VE framework in for CS50 final project.

### Background
I'm taking inspiration from games that I like the most when I was a kid: arena shooter games. 
I'm hoping this game will make the player happy.

### How to play
Move your mouse cursor to move the ship; ship follows the mouse cursor. The farther the cursor to the ship the faster it moves.
Press spacebar to fire the bullet from the ship and aim using the mouse cursor.
Enemy will spawn at random places and follow the ship wherever the ship moves. Fire them to make it dissapear.

#### Last update.
I added feature so that when the bullets hit the enemy, they both will dissapear. Previously this feature didn't work
because I incorporated other feature that would make a bullet dissapear 4 seconds after the player firing it.
