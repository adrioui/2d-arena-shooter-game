> Welcome to my game, Space Shooter! I developed this game using Lua with the LOVE2D framework as my final project for CS50. As a lifelong gamer, I decided to explore game development for my project. Top-down shooters have always been one of my favorite genres because they are both fun and challenging. Although this was my first time developing a game, I dedicated my leisure time after work to bring this game to life. It was a challenging process, but I'm proud of what I have accomplished. I drew inspiration from the arena shooter games that I loved playing as a child. My goal was to create a game that would bring joy to the players.

## How to Play

‚ãÖ‚ãÖ* Move your mouse cursor to control the spaceship. The ship will follow the cursor's movements.

‚ãÖ‚ãÖ* The ship's speed increases the farther away the cursor is from the ship.

‚ãÖ‚ãÖ* Press the spacebar to fire bullets from the ship. Aim your shots using the mouse cursor.

‚ãÖ‚ãÖ* Enemies will spawn randomly and relentlessly chase your ship. Shoot them to make them disappear.

‚ãÖ‚ãÖ* Be cautious, as there are two types of enemies: some will only chase you, while others will continuously fire bullets at you.

‚ãÖ‚ãÖ* Your health bar will decrease if you get hit by enemy fire. If it reaches zero, the game will restart.

‚ãÖ‚ãÖ* Keep an eye on your fuel level. It decreases each time you fire bullets. Use your shots wisely!

‚ãÖ‚ãÖ* Your ultimate objective is to survive the onslaught of enemies and emerge victorious!

Feel the adrenaline rush as you navigate through the intense battles of Space Shooter! Get ready for a thrilling and challenging gaming experience.

Now, buckle up and show the universe what you're made of!
