## Space Shooter!
## 2d Arena Shooter game made with LOVE2D framework in Lua for CS50 final project.

### Background
This is a game I made using Lua with LOVE2D framework. I chose my final project to be a game development project because from the early age I love playing games. Well actually, I played game a lot. I decided to go with top down shooter because it is one of my favorite genres of game: fun to play and challenging! This development proccess took quite some time and was kind of hard to me because this is my first time developing a game. I'm currently having a job (thanks to CS50!) so I took my leisure after work time to finish this game. I did my best.

I'm taking inspiration from games that I like the most when I was a kid: arena shooter games. 
I'm hoping this game will make the player happy.

Enemy will spawn at random places and follow the ship wherever the ship moves. Fire them to make them dissapear.

There are two types of enemy. The one that will only chase you and the one that will chase and fire bullets continuously toward you

Game will restart if your health bar reach 0. 

Fuel decreased every time you fire the bullets. Be smart!

You have to survive!!
