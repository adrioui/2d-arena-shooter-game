Note: this game is still under development.
## 2d Arena Shooter game made with LÖVE framework in lua for CS50 final project.

### Background
I'm taking inspiration from games that I like the most when I was a kid: arena shooter games. 
I'm hoping this game will make the player happy.

### How to download
1. Download and install [LÖVE](https://www.love2d.org/) in your computer.

2. Download this file [2d Arena Shooter Game](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Lcp0zCnyubbfjD_27RK4mgf7xDnkIUv/view?usp=share_link).

3. Run the .love file and enjoy the game :). 

### How to play
Move your mouse cursor to move the ship; ship follows the mouse cursor. 

The farther the cursor to the ship the faster it moves.

Press spacebar to fire the bullet from the ship and aim using the mouse cursor.

Enemy will spawn at random places and follow the ship wherever the ship moves. Fire them to make them dissapear.

#### Current updates
25/11/2022: Check collision between the character and enemy to make the enemy dissapear, if collided.
And check collision between the bullet and enemy. 

26/11/2022: Make the bullet dissapear after 4 seconds it fired from the ship.

27/11/2022: Added a feature so that when the bullet hit the enemy, they both will dissapear. Previously this feature didn't work
because I incorporated other feature that would make a bullet dissapear 4 seconds after the player firing it.

27/11/2022: Add enemy that shoot bullets toward the player.

#### Latest updates
28/11/2022: Change the previous feature. Make the enemy firing bullets toward the same direction as the bullets fired from the player. 

28/11/2022: Make the enemy firing bullets toward the player. Check collision between enemies of type 1 and make them dissapear 
if collided.

29/11/2022: Check collision between enemies of type 2 and make them dissapear if collided.
